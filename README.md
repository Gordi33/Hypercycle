# Hypercycle from Manfred Eigen (chemist). 

Cycle breaks sooner or later with only having one survivor colour.

Game starts with a fix number of colours which are randomly equally-distributed on a two-dimensional grid.
A playing_move implies subsituting a colour with another colour accoring the set-up. 
Accorindg to that rule only one colour survives.

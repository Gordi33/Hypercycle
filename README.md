## The-Laws-of-the-Game
### How-The-Principles-of-Nature-Govern-Chance

Implemented and visualized a few chosen games from Nobel laureate Manfred Eigen and Ruthild Winkler, who show how the elements of chance and rules underlie all that happens in the universe, from genetic behavior through economic growth to the composition of music. 

As well as own ideas.

## [**Hypercycle**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/Hypercycle.ipynb) 

Manfred Eigen's Hypercycle modelled in a ball-game. The winner-colour takes it all and is the only survivor. Cycle breaks sooner or later with only having one survivor colour.

 - Part 3: Play the game until one colour "takes it all" on a 10x10 grid having six colours initially.
 - Part 4: Plot colour-path in a line plot.
 - Part 5: Plot playground evolution in 16-steps.
 - Part 6: Simulate "One-Colour-takes-it-all distribution"
 - Part 7: Line-plot animation
 - Part 8: Playing-ground animation

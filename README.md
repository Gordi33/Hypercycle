### [**Hypercycle**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/Hypercycle.ipynb)

Manfred Eigen's Hypercycle modelled in a ball-game. The **winner-colour takes it all** and is the only survivor.

 - Part 3: Play the game until one colour **takes it all** on a 10x10 grid having six colours initially. Plot colour-path in a line plot and the playground evolution in 16-steps.
 - Part 4: Simulate "One-Colour-takes-it-all distribution".
 - Part 5: Line-plot and Playing-ground animation.

### [**Player's survival when throwing dices**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/PlayersSurvivalWhenThrowingDices.ipynb)

Player's survival' i.e., **staying in the game** represents an introduction to the principle of **Time-on-device-Players vs. Gamblers**, one important indicator of describing players, their preferences and their behaviour.

 - Part 3: Compute for one to eight dices the survival distributions i.e., **player's death occurance** and their KPIs.
 - Part 4: Visualise and plot the results.

### [**Distribution computation in C# accessed via REST-API for multiple events having multiple weighted outcomes**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/DistributionComputation.ipynb)

Computing the distribution allows to modell **game design' specific payout-profiles**.
Deriving a general formula allows to determine the exact distribution on equally-distributed outcomes. A cylce-evaluation further allows to consider weighted-outcomes. 
 
 - Part 3: Deriving a general formula for a fixed number of equally-distributed outcomes for each event. Creating a game specific payout for events having equally-distributed outcomes based on the distribution.
 - Part 4: Cycle evaluation for a fixed number of events with weighted-outcomes in **C# accessed via REST-API**. Assuming different szenarios for the weights and creating a game specific payouts based on the computed distribution.
 - Part 5: RTP'impact of the different szenarios for increased volatility on the weights.

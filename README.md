# Hypercycle from Manfred Eigen (chemist). 

Cycle breaks sooner or later with only having one survivor colour.

Game starts with a fix number of colours which are randomly equally-distributed on a two-dimensional grid.
A playing_move implies subsituting a colour with another colour according the set-up-rule. 
According to that rule only one colour survives.
How many games resp. playing_moves need to be played until one colour reaches 100% depends on the grid and and the number of colours (and on the set-up-rule).

## [**Hypercycle**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/Hypercycle.ipynb)

Manfred Eigen's Hypercycle modelled in a ball-game. The winner-colour takes it all and is the only survivor. 

 - Part 3: Play the game until one colour "takes it all" on a 10x10 grid having six colours initially. and plot colour-path in a line plot and the playground evolution in 16-steps.
 - Part 4: Simulate "One-Colour-takes-it-all distribution"
 - Part 5: Line-plot and Playing-ground animation

## Player's survival when throwing dices

Player's survival <<< **staying in the game** >>> represents an introduction the the principle of Time-on-device-Players vs. Gamblers.

 - Part 3: Compute for one to eight dices the survival distributions and KPIs
 - Part 4: Visualise and plot the results

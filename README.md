### [**Hypercycle**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/Hypercycle.ipynb)

Manfred Eigen's Hypercycle modelled in a ball-game. The **winner-colour takes it all** and is the only survivor.

 - Part 3: Play the game until one colour **takes it all** on a 10x10 grid having six colours initially. Plot colour-path in a line plot and the playground evolution in 16-steps.
 - Part 4: Simulate "One-Colour-takes-it-all distribution".
 - Part 5: Line-plot and Playing-ground animation.

### [**Player's survival when throwing dices**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/The-Laws-of-the-Game/blob/master/Dices_Game.ipynb)

Player's survival' **staying in the game** represents an introduction to the principle of **Time-on-device-Players vs. Gamblers**.

 - Part 3: Compute for one to eight dices the survival distributions' **player's death occurance** and their KPIs.
 - Part 4: Visualise and plot the results.

### **Distribution computation in C# for multiple manipluated dices via REST-API**

Computing the distribution allows to modell **game design' specific payouts**.
The general formula allows to determine the exact distribution on equally-distributed outcomes. A cylce-evaluation further allows to consider weighted-outcomes. 
 
 - Part 3: A general formula for a fixed number of equally-distributed outcomes for each dice. Creating a game' payout based on the distribution.
 - Part 4: Cycle evaluation for a fixed number of events with weighted-outcomes in **C# accessed via REST-API**.
